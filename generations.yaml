    description: "The Toyota Corolla iM represented a brief but significant chapter in the Corolla lineage in North America, originally introduced as the Scion iM before being rebranded as a Toyota after the discontinuation of the Scion brand. Essentially the North American version of the European Toyota Auris (itself a Corolla hatchback variant in other markets), the Corolla iM offered a sportier, more practical alternative to the Corolla sedan. Built on the same platform as the eleventh-generation Corolla but with different styling, the iM featured a distinctive five-door hatchback design with more aggressive lines, standard 17-inch alloy wheels, and a generally more youthful appearance than the sedan. Powered by a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine producing 137 horsepower and 126 lb-ft of torque, the iM was available with either a six-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT) with manual mode and seven simulated gear steps. The interior featured a more modern design than the contemporary Corolla sedan, with piano black accents, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system as standard equipment. In keeping with the former Scion brand's 'mono-spec' philosophy, the iM was offered in a single well-equipped trim level with a limited number of dealer-installed options. Standard safety features included Toyota's Safety Sense C with pre-collision system, lane departure alert, and automatic high beams—advanced technology for its price point at the time. The Corolla iM successfully bridged the gap between Scion's discontinuation and the introduction of the twelfth-generation Corolla hatchback, offering North American consumers a more European-flavored compact hatchback experience wearing the trusted Corolla badge, though with somewhat compromised performance due to its relatively modest power output compared to some competitors."
